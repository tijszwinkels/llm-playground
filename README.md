# LLM Playground

Very simple playground for interfacing with (future: several) LLM api's. Work in progress.
For advanced use, there's a few advantages to a playground-style interface over a chat interface:
- No inspiration? Just Leave the User: prompt and let GPT generate a question.
- Edit the response of the model if you're not happy with it.
- Partly edit the model response, and let the model fill in the rest. 

### Usage

Visit on: https://TinkerTankAI.github.io/llm-playground/

### Instructions

Fill out your query next to the "User:" prompt
Click the "Generate" button to generate text.

- Anything you enter can be stored by the api provider and/or the creators of this software and might be shared as part of public datasets.
- Don't enter any credentials or private data
- Use this tool ethically and responsibly
- Have fun! :)

Obtain an api-key at: platform.openai.com/account/api-keys - Click the cog icon to configure the api-key.
